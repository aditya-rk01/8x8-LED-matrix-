# 8x8-LED-matrix-
Building 8x8 matrix from scratch and printing characters on it using Arduino

Theory
An 8*8 matrix LED display which common cathode based. That is all the cathodes of 8 LEDs in the row are connected together, also anode of 8 LEDs in column are connected. So, there will be 16 pins in the display and every LED in the 64 can be accessed using these 16 pins. These 16 pins are connected to Arduino and Letters can be shown on the display using the code in the Arduino.
